### Evaluation of Randomized Numbers for Cryptographic Purposes and their Applications in the Age of Quantum Computers

The focus of this work is to investigate different random bit generators and analyze
their security strength based on the proposed gap-based approach. The scope of
gap-based approach is extended to quantum random bit generators.

This work provides detailed information on widely used random bit generators and
bit generation process in the field of cryptography. These generator algorithms are
reviewed in detail with a comprehensive study on their construction architecture
and properties.

This set of information on generators opens up a wide angled scientific view
for a design of an advanced random bit generator. This generator design is in accordance
with cryptographic requirements by using quantum-based approach. All
these bit generators are implemented to generate a set of random bit sequences for
the randomness analysis purpose.

This work also provides comprehensive information on the analysis methods such
as a gap-based approach and the statistical test suit (provided by NIST). These methods are designed to
provide a measure of patterns and randomness.

The process of randomness evaluation on the generated sequences has utilized these
methods to provide graphical representations based on the calculated results. This
analysis provides an overall performance of generators as well as each bit sequence.
Moreover, this evaluation also provides an insight on a correlation of these analysis
methods based on the results.
